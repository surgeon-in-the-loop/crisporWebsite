Ethically Governed Precision Gene Therapy: Governance and Ethical Compliance

This manuscript outlines the integration of ethical guidelines and regulatory standards within the gene therapy platform. The project adheres to the IBM AI Ethics Toolkit to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in all AI-driven processes. Data protection is maintained in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) through rigorous de-identification protocols, strict access controls, and encryption. Furthermore, the system aligns with the World Health Organization's (WHO) AI governance principles, emphasizing human-centric design and continuous risk management. All code modifications and decision processes are tracked via GitHub, with automated logging mechanisms ensuring an auditable trail. This framework ensures that the platform meets high ethical standards and supports safe, equitable clinical applications.
